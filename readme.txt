Prompts the user when they leave your blog, showing a "last chance" exit page behind the prompt. 

== Description ==

The Exit Screen Plugin works by detecting when a reader of your blog closes the browser or loads another page. When the reader leaves your blog, a dialogue box will appear. Behind it a page of your choice will be seen. This is the last chance to catch your reader's attention.

You can Specify the URL of any web page that you want to have as the last page readers see. It will be behind a dialogue box and, in some browsers, it may be dimmed. It would be a simple page with large type near the top. The page should have a clear message with information that will cause the reader to cancel the action of leaving your page. Since it is behind the dialogue box, which will be the focus of your reader's attention, it must be a real grabber with large colorful text above and below where the dialog box will appear. I would suggest hand-crafting a static page with this in mind. Autostart audio or video will capture a reader's attention. Other options are to send readers to your Amazon page, an eBay auction listing, or other affiliate page.

Note: Some themes do not correctly implement a footer. This code is installed in the footer event, so it will not work with incomplete or defective themes.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin.
2. Upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Under settings, specify the URL of your exit page and the exit dialog message. The dialog message displays in IE, but not FireFox.
